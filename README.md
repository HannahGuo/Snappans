# Snappans

Snappans is a fun Discord bot I'm building as a side project, mainly being used in servers with my friends. Though some functionality may eventually be ported over to a published discord bot. 

Who knows?

### Why... is it called Snappans?

I use variations of the word "snap" for my username on some platforms... and my name is Hannah so... I thought it was funny.
